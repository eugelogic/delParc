# delParc

This is the new delParc website - Spring 2018 - I will share the actual url as soon as the site is live.

delParc is a Intimate Modern Tapas Restaurant with a North African Twist based in North London between Tufnell Park and Archway.

The website is built with [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) the modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and built with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) with the aid of [Atlas](https://github.com/indigotree/atlas)

Content is handled with [NetlifyCSM](https://www.netlifycms.org/), an open source content management for Git workflow.

The homepage has been built upon a modern CSS Grid

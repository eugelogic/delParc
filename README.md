# delParc

This is what is leaft of the delParc website - (Summer 2018-Winter 2020) - [https://www.delparc.com/](https://www.delparc.com/)

delParc used to be an Intimate Modern Tapas Restaurant with a North African Twist based in North London between Tufnell Park and Archway.

The website was built with [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) the modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

The site is still hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) but no longer uses [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and [Atlas](https://github.com/indigotree/atlas)

The holding page is a straight forward static html document.
